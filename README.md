Problem statement

Event management and ticketing often face challenges due to the lack of integration with modern financial technologies, resulting in inefficiencies in payment processing, fraud prevention, and ticket verification. Organizers struggle to handle secure and seamless transactions while ensuring ticket authenticity, and attendees encounter issues with unreliable systems, payment flexibility, and ticket validity. These gaps lead to inefficiency, fraud risks, and a poor user experience, highlighting the need for a robust, FinTech-powered solution to address these challenges.
